## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a variety of data structures and algorithms implemented in a clean and understandable manner. The focus is on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. Each implementation is accompanied by a detailed explanation and complexity analysis to help you grasp the underlying concepts thoroughly.

## Data Structures

This section includes classic and advanced data structures that are fundamental to computer science and software engineering:

- **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, and Circularly Linked Lists
- **Stacks and Queues**: Array-based and Linked List-based implementations
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Tries
- **Graphs**: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
- **Heaps**: Binary Heaps, Fibonacci Heaps
- **Hash Tables**: Chaining, Open Addressing
- **Others**: Sets, Maps, Bloom Filters, Priority Queues

## Algorithms

The algorithms section covers a wide range of essential algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, A* Search
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, Fibonacci
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman Coding, Prim’s Algorithm
- **Divide and Conquer**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Matrix Multiplication
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens Problem, Subset Sum, Sudoku Solver

## Complexity Analysis

Each implementation includes a complexity analysis section, where you can find:

- **Time Complexity**: Best, average, and worst-case scenarios
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage and optimization considerations

This analysis will help you understand the efficiency and trade-offs of each algorithm and data structure in different contexts.

## How to Use

## Problems to fix:
1. extra/LinkedPositionalListGui.java is not working properly

## Problems fixed:
1. extra/Josephus.java was not working properly
2. lists/ListAdapter.java was suffering from backing problem
3. some interfaces started with H, whereas others did not
4. lists/*.java had minor issues, now are well linked together
